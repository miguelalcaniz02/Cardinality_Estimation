# Cardinality Estimation
Third assignment of the Randomized Algorithms (RA-MIRI) course. The purpose of this assignment is the implementation of the cardinality estimation algorithms HyperLogLog and Recordinality and the comparison of their performance experimentally.
# Usage
The github repository contains some python files with the methods Hyperloglog, Recordinality and a generator of synthetic data. Also two files used to study the behaviour of the methos for real datasets and for synthetic data, when executed these generate a table with some parameters to study their performance.
# Requirements 
It's required to have python 3 installed. Also the libraries used in the code, such as numpy, math, hashlib and string.
